# .Net-Load-Balancer
A simple load balancer implemented using ASP.NET Core

This is a lightweight bundle that supports :

1. Filters
2. Chaching
3. Rewrite
4. Balancing
5. Host

Whole application is written in .NET Core, so it can be run as embedded app or in a webserver.

The main principle is to provide an easy to use solution that can be installed in 5 minutes.

Every feature of application is implemented with its own owin module that can be enabled or disabled by cofiguration.
Each module is configurable by a dedicated config file.
